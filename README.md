# Unit 2: A Distributed Weather Station for ISAK

## Criteria A: Planning

## Problem definition

## Proposed Solution
**Design statement**


## Success Criteria

1. The solution provides a visual representation of the Humidity and Temperature values inside a dormitory (Local) and outside the house (Remote) for a period of minimum 48 hours.
2. The solution provides a mathematical modelling for the Humidity and Temperature levels for each Local and Remote locations. (SL: linear model, HL: non-lineal model)
3. The solution provides a comparative analysis for the Humidity and Temperature levels for each Local and Remote locations including mean, standad deviation, minimum, maximum, and median.
4. (SL)The Local samples are stored in a csv file. (HL) The local samples are posted to the remote server.
5. A user manual is provided for the solution.
6. A poster summarizing the visual representations, model and analysis is created and communicated.
